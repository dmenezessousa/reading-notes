## Markdown Basic Syntax

#### Headings
-to create a heading use _#_ in front of the header
 - ex: _## Header_ would be the second largest header
-always add spaces between the pound sign and the header you're choosing
 - ex: _# Header_ not _#Header_
-you should also put blank lines before and after a heading for compatibility
 - try to always put a blank line before and a blank line after

#### Paragraphs
-use one or more lines to seperate the text
-don't put tabs or spaces before the paragraph

#### Emphasis
-bold: use two stars or two underscores but keep it consistent with no spaces in between
 - ** Bold **
-italic: use one star or one underscore with no spaces in between
 - _ Italic _

#### Blockquotes
-to create a blockquote, add a > in front of a paragraph.
 - _> Paragraph_

#### Ordered Lists
- add line items with numbers followed by periods
 - 1. a
 - 2. b
 - 3. c

#### Unordered List
-add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items. Indent one or more items to create a nested list

#### Links
-To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Duck Duck Go]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://duckduckgo.com))
 - My favorite search engine is [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com)
