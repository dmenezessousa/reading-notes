## Video and Audio Content

1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.

   -Early in the web's life, video and audio were not natively supported by HTML, and were embedded through software solutions like Flash, which had security issues. HTML now has native support with the `<audio>` and `<video>` tags.

2. Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element.

   -The `<video>` tag is used to embed video into a page.

3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?

   -The text inside the video tag is fallback content, which is similar to the alt attribute in an image. Often it is used to provide a hyperlink to the source of the video.

4. Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters.

   -Audio and his brother video both likes to perform. However audio is very shy and only likes to be heard and not be seem, on the other hand video loves attention the more people that views him the better.

## A Complete Guide To Grid

1. How does Grid layout differ from Flex?

   -Grid differs from flex is that it’s 2 dimensional grid based layout than flex which is 1 dimensional. You’re able to adjust along the x and y axis.

2. Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.

   -Grid Container: The element on which display: grid is applied. It’s the direct parent of all the grid items
   -Grid Item: The children (i.e. direct descendants) of the grid container.
   -Grid Line: The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be either vertical (“column grid lines”) or horizontal (“row grid lines”) and reside on either side of a row or column.

## Responsive Images

1. Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?

   -Responsive images ensure important content is being focused on, as well as giving a visually pleasing layout.

2. Define the following <img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.

   -srcrset: is a string that contains alternate image files and sizes, used to help the browser present more size appropriate content
   -sizes: is a string that contains image size criteria to tell the browser when to use alternate images

3. How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?

   -Images are loaded before CSS or JavaScript are applied, meaning that the browser doesn’t have the opportunity to load a smaller, faster-loading image, if that would have been the best one for the viewport size.
