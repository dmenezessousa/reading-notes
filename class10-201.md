## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

   -Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through — you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!

   -Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn’t an error message to direct you to the source of the error.

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

   -Unexpected token: I think this is what it says when I either have either not enough or one too many curly braces.

   -Type error: 'can't do x to type Null' I get these when I'm referencing something incorrectly

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

   -better understand the different types of error

## The JavaScript Debugger.

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

   -The JavaScript Debugger allows you to step through your program, line by line, or set stopping points within the code, to see the state of things at each step of the way or at a certain moment in the program’s time.

2. Define what a breakpoint is.

   -When a programmer creates code they can add what is known as a breakpoint. A breakpoint is a point in the program where the code will stop executing

3. What is the call stack?

   -The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.
