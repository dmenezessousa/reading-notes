Behavioral Questions:

Question 1: Tell Me About Yourself...

- The past few years, I’ve gotten really into coding. I love the challenge of creating some new. I like using my problem-solving skills to debug and make an app or website work. Learning on how to work with other to complete some projects helped me tremendously with my work. It’s all about learning to help others and improve myself.

Question 2: Why Should We Hire You?

- I believe that my experience with technology, specifically in the web development space, make me the best match for this position. In my previous job, I have just gratuated a web development bootcamp . This required me to meet some criteria with my work and I have a vast portofolio that I can show to you. I truly enjoyed what I was doing, which is what drew me to this position with your company. I would love to bring the coding and content skills I learned there to this position.

Question 3: What Is Your Greatest Strength?

- I have a solid work ethic. When I'm working on a project, I don't just want to meet deadlines. Rather, I prefer to complete the project well ahead of schedule. Last year, I even earned a bonus for completing my three most recent reports one week ahead of time.
