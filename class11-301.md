## nosql vs sql

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

SQL	 -
    1. Relational Databases.
    2. Structured Query Language.
    3. Table based databases.
    4. Predefined schema.
    5. Vertically scalable.

NoSQL - 
    1. Non-relational Databases.
    2. Unstructured Query Language.
    3. Document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.
    4. Dynamic schema for unstructured data.
    5. Horizontally scalable.

What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
Give a real world example.

    -SQL databases are good for structured data, such as data that is stored in tables. An example of this would be a database of a company's employees, where each employee has a name, age, and address.

What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
Give a real world example.
    
    -NoSQL databases are good for unstructured data, such as data that is stored in key-value pairs. An example of this would be a database of a company's employees, where each employee has a name, age, and address.

Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

    -SQL databases are best for hierarchical data storage. An example of this would be a database of a company's employees, where each employee has a name, age, and address.

Which type of database is best for scalability?

What does SQL stand for?
    
    -SQL stands for Structured Query Language.

What is a relational database?
        
    -A relational database is a database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

What type of structure does a relational database work with?
            
    -A relational database works with a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database.

What is a ‘schema’?
                    
    -A schema is a collection of database objects linked to a particular database username. The objects in the schema include tables, views, sequences, indexes, triggers, and other elements.

What is a NoSQL database?
                            
    -A NoSQL database is a database that stores and provides access to data that is not in a traditional table format.

How does it work?
                                    
    -NoSQL databases store data in key-value pairs, documents, graph databases, or wide-column stores.     

What is inside of a Mongo database?

    -A Mongo database is made up of collections and documents. A collection is a group of MongoDB documents. It is the equivalent of an RDBMS table. A document is a set of key-value pairs. It is the equivalent of a RDBMS record.

Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

    -MongoDB is more flexible than SQL because it is a document database, which means that it stores data in JSON-like documents. This makes it easier to store and access data.

What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

    -The disadvantage of a NoSQL database is that it is not as structured as a SQL database. This means that it is not as easy to query and join data.
