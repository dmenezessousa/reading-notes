## What is OAuth

What is OAuth?

    OAuth is an open standard for authorization, commonly used as a way for Internet users to authorize websites or applications to access their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords. This mechanism is used by companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter to permit the users to share information about their accounts with third party applications or websites.

Give an example of what using OAuth would look like.

    OAuth would look like a user logging into a website using their Facebook account. The user would be asked to give permission to the website to access their Facebook account. The website would then be able to access the user's Facebook account information.

How does OAuth work? What are the steps that it takes to authenticate the user?

    OAuth works by having the user log into a website using their Facebook account. The website would then be able to access the user's Facebook account information. The user would be asked to give permission to the website to access their Facebook account. The website would then be able to access the user's Facebook account information.

What is OpenID?

    OpenID is an open standard and decentralized authentication protocol. OpenID is about authentication: as a commenter on StackOverflow has it, "OpenID is for humans logging into machines, OAuth is for machines logging into machines on behalf of humans."

## Authorization and Authentication flows

What is the difference between authorization and authentication?

    Authorization is the process of giving someone permission to do something. Authentication is the process of verifying that someone is who they say they are.

What is Authorization Code Flow?

    Authorization Code Flow is an OAuth 2.0 flow that exchanges an Authorization Code for a token. The Authorization Code Flow is used to obtain both access tokens and refresh tokens and is optimized for confidential clients.

What is Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)?

    Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is an OAuth 2.0 flow that exchanges an Authorization Code for a token. The Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is used to obtain both access tokens and refresh tokens and is optimized for public clients.

What is Implicit Flow with Form Post?

    Implicit Flow with Form Post is an OAuth 2.0 flow that obtains an access token and optionally an ID token directly from the authorization server. The Implicit Flow with Form Post is optimized for public clients known to operate a particular redirection URI.

What is Client Credentials Flow?

    Client Credentials Flow is an OAuth 2.0 flow that requests an access token using only the client's credentials (or other supported means of authentication) when the client is requesting access to the protected resources under its control, or those of another resource owner that have been previously arranged with the authorization server (the method of which is beyond the scope of this specification).

What is Device Authorization Flow?

    Device Authorization Flow is an OAuth 2.0 flow that enables devices with no browser or limited input capability to obtain an access token. The Device Authorization Flow is optimized for devices such as smart TVs, digital picture frames, and printers as well as input-constrained devices such as smart watches and appliances.

What is Resource Owner Password Flow?

    Resource Owner Password Flow is an OAuth 2.0 flow that requests an access token using the credentials of an existing user. The Resource Owner Password Flow is optimized for clients capable of obtaining the resource owner's credentials (username and password, typically using an interactive form).
