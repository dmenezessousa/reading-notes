## React Docs - Forms

What is a ‘Controlled Component’? 
    
    -A controlled component is a component that renders form elements and controls them by keeping the form data in the component's state.

Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

    -We should update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them. This is because we want to be able to see the changes as they happen.

How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

    -We can use the event.target.value to target what the user is entering.

## The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

Why would we use a ternary operator?

    -We would use a ternary operator to simplify an if/else statement.

Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

````if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}````

`console.log(x===y ? true : false)`
