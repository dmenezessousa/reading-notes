# Readings: HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?

- To create a list of related items, in no particular order.

How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?

- list-style-type : 

When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?

Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?

- To create a list of related items, in a specific order.

## Learn CSS, The Box Model

Describe the CSS properties of margin and padding as characters in a story. What is their role in a story titled: “The Box Model”?

List and describe the four parts of an HTML elements box as referred to by the box model.

- Content box: The area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like inline-size and block-size or width and height.

- Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties.

- Border box: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties.

- Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; size it using margin and related properties.

## Learn JS Arrays. Operators and Expressions. Conditionals. Loops

What data types can you store inside of an Array?

- It can store strings, numbers, objects, and even other arrays

Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not, why?

- Yes it is a valid array

- Access the values by ``people[1][2][3]``

````
const people = [['pete', 32, 'librarian', null], ['Smith', 40, 'accountant', 'fishing:hiking:rock_climbing'], ['bill', null, 'artist', null]];
````

List five shorthand operators for assignment in javascript and describe what they do.

|Operator|Meaning|Description|
|----|----|----|
|a = b |a = b |Assigns the value of b to a.|
|a += b | a = a + b | Assigns the result of a plus b to a.|
|a -= b|a = a - b|Assigns the result of a minus b to a.|
|a /= b| a = a / b| Assigns the result of a divided by b to a.|
|a *= b|a = a * b|Assigns the result of a times b to a.|



Read the code below and evaluate the last expression and explain what the result would be and why.

 ````let a = 10;
 let b = 'dog';
 let c = false;

 // evaluate this
 (a + c) + b;
 ````

- The Result would be a string = '10dog', first we adding number 10 to a false statement so we return only the true output then we add it with the string 'dog' resolting in the string '10dog'.

Describe a real world example of when a conditional statement should be used in a JavaScript program.

````let light = "green";

if(light){
    console.log("You can go!");
}else if(light === "red"){
    console.log("Stop, You can't go!")
}else{
    console.log("Be careful")
}
````

Give an example of when a Loop is useful in JavaScript.

- when counting numbers until it reaches a certain value:

````const i = 1;
while(i <= 1000) {    
    document.write("<p>The number is " + i + "</p>");
    i++;
}
````
