## Status Codes Based On REST Methods

In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:

    100’s = Informational status codes
    200’s = Success codes
    300’s = Redirection codes
    400’s = Client error codes
    500’s = Server error codes

What is a status code 202?

    -Accepted - The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The request might or might not be eventually acted upon, and may be disallowed when processing occurs.

What is a status code 308?

    -Permanent Redirect - This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.

What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?

    -204 No Content

What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?

    -410 Gone

What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?

    -403 Forbidden - The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it. Authorization will not help and the request SHOULD NOT be repeated.

What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201?

    -200 OK - The request has succeeded. The information returned with the response is dependent on the method used in the request, for example: GET an entity corresponding to the requested resource is sent in the response; HEAD the entity-header fields corresponding to the requested resource are sent in the response without any message-body; POST an entity describing or containing the result of the action; TRACE an entity containing the request message as received by the end server.
