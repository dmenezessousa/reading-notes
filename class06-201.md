# Javascript Object

1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?

- An Object is a container that holds named data and other smaller containers that can be access, added to and changed.Like someone's name , age and etc...

2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?

- It makes it easier when you are trying to transfer/get data to and from a database.

3. How do objects differ from arrays?

- They are very similar, however, instead of calling on an index with an array, you would call on the member’s value or KEY. This makes the use of .map() values easier to read and understand.

4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an object’s property instead of dot notation.

- When or if an object property name is defined at runtime then you can’t use dot notation to access the value, but you can pass the name as a variable inside brackets

5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?

const dog = {
name: 'Spot',
age: 2,
color: 'white with black spots',
humanAge: function (){
console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age*7} in human years`);
}
}

- "This" refer to the value in this object which is the dog variable, which makes it to refer the the information inside the object.

### Introduction To The DOM

1. What is the DOM?

- The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. This guide will introduce the DOM, look at how the DOM represents an HTML document in memory and how to use APIs to create web content and applications. Is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

2. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.

- Javascript uses the DOM to access the documents and its elements for a web page for example. They can all be accessed and manipulated using the DOM and JavaScript.

### Things I want to know more about

I want to know more about construhow to get and append a child from and to the HTML from javascript, and how to use them.
