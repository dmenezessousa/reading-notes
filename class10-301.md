## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack

What is a ‘call’?

    -A call is a function invocation (AKA ‘calling a function’).

How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

    -One.

What does LIFO mean?
    
        -Last In, First Out.

Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.
    
    -function firstFunction(){
        throw new Error('Stack Trace Error');
    }
        
    function secondFunction(){
            firstFunction();
    }
        
    function thirdFunction(){
            secondFunction();
    }
        
    thirdFunction();

What causes a Stack Overflow?
    
    -A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point.

## JavaScript error messages

What is a ‘reference error’?
        
    -This is as simple as when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.

What is a ‘syntax error’?
            
    -This occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.

What is a ‘range error’?

    -Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of errors will show up.

What is a ‘type error’?

    -This types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.

What is a breakpoint?

    -A breakpoint is a point in your code that you can use to debug your code.

What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?

    -The debugger keyword stops the execution of your code, and calls (if available) the debugging function. This has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the debugger.
