## Functional Programming Concepts


What is functional programming?

    -Functional programming is a programming paradigm - a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs - that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

    -It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)

What are the benefits of a pure function?

    -The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts:

What is immutability?

    -Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

What is Referential transparency?   

    -If a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.

## Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()


What is a module?

    -A module is a piece of code that is wrapped in a function. It has access to the module scope, which means it can access variables and functions that are defined in the module scope.

What does the word ‘require’ do?

    -It allows you to bring in other modules into the current module.

How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?

    -We use the require() function.

What do we have to do to make a module available?

    -We have to export it.
