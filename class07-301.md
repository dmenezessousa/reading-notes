## How I explained REST to my brother

Who is Roy Fielding?

    -Roy Fielding is one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style.

Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
    
    -Because they weren’t designed to be used like that. They were designed to be used by a small group of people, but not the entire world.

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
    
    -HTTP is all about applying verbs to nouns. For example, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

What does a GET do?

    -GET is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.

What does a POST do?
                
    -POST is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.

What does PUT do?

    -PUT is used to send data to the server to create/update a resource.

What does PATCH do?

    -PATCH is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
