## React Docs - lists and keys

What does .map() return?

    -.map() returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?

    -You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces {}.

Each list item needs a unique ____.

    -key

What is the purpose of a key?

    -Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.

## The Spread Operator

What is the spread operator?

    -The spread operator is a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a functionâ€™s arguments.

List 4 things that the spread operator can do.

1. Copying an array
2. Concatenating or combining arrays
3. Using Math functions
4. Using an array as arguments

Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.

```const myArray = [1, 2, 3] 
const yourArray = [4, 5, 6] 
const ourArray = [...myArray, ...yourArray] console.log(ourArray) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]```

Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

```const myArray = [1, 2, 3]
const yourArray = [4, 5, 6]
const ourArray = [...myArray, ...yourArray, 7, 8, 9]
console.log(ourArray) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]```

Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.

```const myObject = { 
  name: 'Diego', 
  age: 30, 
  location: 'Seattle' 
}
const yourObject = { 
  name: 'Miguel', 
  age: 30, 
  location: 'Seattle' 
}
const ourObject = { 
  ...myObject, 
  ...yourObject, 
  name: 'Diego & Miguel' 
}
```

## How to Pass Functions Between Components

In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?

    -The first step is to create a function in the parent component.

In your own words, what does the increment function do?

    -It increments the count by 1.

How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?

    -You can pass a method from a parent component into a child component by passing it as a prop.

How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?

    -The child component invokes a method that was passed to it from a parent component by using props.
