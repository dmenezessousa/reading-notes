## HTML Forms

1. Why are forms so important in web development?

   -Forms are important in web development because a form is one of the most fundamental ways that sites can interact with users and receive information from them.

2. When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?

   -When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience? Simplicity is key. You shouldnâ€™t have a rather complex or large form to fill, just keep it to the main things and leave it at that. A few text fields and buttons. You want the form to be usuable by anyone with ease.

3. List 5 form elements and explain their importance.

   -`<form>` - this is the main form element, and contains the other elements that comprise the content of your form.
   -the action attribute defines where a forms data should go when submitted (URL).
   -the method attribute says which HTTP method to send the data in (usually get or post). -`<label>` - this defines the label that will sit next to an adjacent input field. -`<input>` - this is a single line input field that can be given attributes to provide integrated form validation, sush as taking only text, numbers, emails, etc. -`<textarea>` - this is a multiline input field for things such as email correspondence or other messages and long-form responses. -`<button>` - this element is fairly self-explanatory, and allows a user to let the site know when they're done with the form and submit

1. How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

   -Events would be any actions or occurrences that happen based on user interaction. For example, when a user clicks a submit button, that is an event.

2. When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

   -The name of the event some like a submit event
   -A function to handle the event

3. Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

   -It is automatically passed to event handlers to provide extra features and information.

4. What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?

   -Event capturing means propagation of event is done from ancestor elements to child element in the DOM while event bubbling means propagation is done from child element to ancestor elements in the DOM.
