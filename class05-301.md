## React Docs - Thinking in React

What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?

    - The single responsibility principle states that a component should only do one thing. It should be able to be reused and not have to be changed if something else needs to be changed.

What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?

    - A static version of your application is one that has no interactivity. It is just a skeleton of the application.

Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?

    - You need to add interactivity to the application.

What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?

    1. Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
    2. Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
    3. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

How can you identify where state needs to live?

    - Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
    - Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
    - Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
    - If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component simply for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.

## Higher-Order Functions

What is a “higher-order function”?

    - A higher-order function is a function that either takes a function as an argument or returns a function.

Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?

    - Line 2 is returning a function that takes a number as an argument and returns a boolean.

Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.

    - Map takes an array and a function as arguments and returns a new array with the function applied to each element in the array.
    - Reduce takes an array and a function as arguments and returns a single value.
