# Class 07 - Readings: Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

## Domain Modeling

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.

- A domain model that’s articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders. As a communication tool, it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams

## HTML Table Basics

1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?

- Can make the markup structure a mess that is hard to understand.

- There can be complications regarding the with of table elements.

2.  List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML `<table>`.

- Table Data: `<td>`, this is used to create the cell in the table.

- Table Row: `<tr>`, this is used to create the row in the table.

- Table Header: `<th>`, this is used to create the header in a table. Normally, titles that describe the data in table will be used. For example, the header for the first column might read name with unique names is the proceeding rows under that column.

## Introducing Constructors

1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?

- A constructor is basically a function called use a new keyword. It creates a new onject, binds this to the new object so we can refer to this in the constructor code. It’s advantage is it helps eliminate repetitive code.

2. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

- object literal this refers to the single instance of that object.
  Constructor this refers to that being instantiated into multiple instances.

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

## Things I want to know more about.

- Prototypes
- Tables
